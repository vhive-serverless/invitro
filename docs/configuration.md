[^1]: The second granularity feature interprets each column of the trace as a second, rather than as a minute, and
generates IAT for each second. This feature is useful for fine-grained and precise invocation scheduling in experiments
involving stable low load.

[^2]: `_shift` modifies the IAT generation in the following way: by default, generation will create first invocation in
the beginning of the minute, with `_shift` modifier, it will be shifted inside the minute to remove the burst of
invocations from all the functions.

[^3]: Limits are set by resource->limits->CPU in the service YAML. `1vCPU` means limit of 1CPU is set, at the same time
execution is also limited by the container concurrency limit of 1. `GCP` means limits are set to multiples of 1/12th of
vCPU, based on the memory consumption of the function according to
this [table](https://cloud.google.com/functions/pricing#compute_time) for Google Cloud Functions.

[^5]: Function can execute for at most 15 minutes as in AWS
Lambda; https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/10/aws-lambda-supports-functions-that-can-run-up-to-15-minutes/
