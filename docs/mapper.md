# Mapper

The mapper tool can be used to map the functions in a given trace directory (with memory and duration traces) to the proxy functions in the [`vSwarm`](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vSwarm/tree/main/) benchmark suite. The benchmarks present in the vSwarm benchmark suite have been profiled and their memory utilization and duration traces have been collected and stored in the `profile.json` file. Each function in the trace is mapped to a function in the benchmark suite as its closest proxy (based on memory and duration correlation).

The `profile.json` JSON output file is generated by the [`profiler` tool](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vSwarm/tree/load-generator/tools/profiler#profiler) to obtain the profile of the benchmark suite functions.

### Usage

```bash
usage: mapper.py [-h] -t TRACE_DIRECTORYPATH -p PROFILE_FILEPATH [-o OUTPUT_FILEPATH] [-u UNIQUE_ASSIGNMENT]

Arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TRACE_DIRECTORYPATH, --trace-directorypath TRACE_DIRECTORYPATH
                        Path to the directory containing the trace files (required)
  -p PROFILE_FILEPATH, --profile-filepath PROFILE_FILEPATH
                        Path to the profile file containing the proxy functions
```
The tool reads the trace information(memory and duration details) from the `trace/` directory (can be configured using `-t` or `--trace-directorypath` flags). The `trace/` directory must contain the `memory.csv` and `durations.csv` files containing the respective trace information of the format mentioned in [*Azure Functions Dataset 2019*](https://github.com/Azure/AzurePublicDataset/blob/master/AzureFunctionsDataset2019.md)

The [`sampler`](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/invitro/tree/main/sampler) tool in InVitro can be used to generate the sampled traces from the original Azure traces.

For every function in the trace, the closest function in the [`vSwarm`](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vSwarm/tree/main/) benchmark suite is set as its proxy (50-percentile memory and 50-percentile duration are considered to find the highest correlation). The 50th percentile is used to ensure that the mapping is not only corresponding to the peak values of the workload, but is also leading to a representative proxy function. Currently the tool utilizes only _Serving Functions_ that are _NOT Pipelined_ as proxy functions.

Currently, vSwarm does not have full coverage of the Azure trace functions. To make sure that we do not have a high error in the mapping of functions, we set a hard threshold of 40% as the maximum absolute error (from the actual trace function duration) that a proxy function can have to be mapped to a trace function. If we do not find an eligible function for the mapping from vSwarm, we fall back to using standard InVitro sample functions in their place for those functions alone.

This mapping requires the profiles of the benchmark functions for it to be used as a proxy. The tool utilizes the `profile.json` JSON output file generated by the [`profiler` tool](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vSwarm/tree/load-generator/tools/profiler#profiler) to obtain the profile of the benchmark suite functions. The User can configure the path of the JSON file through the `-p` (or `--profile-filepath`) flag (by default, it is `profile.json`, which needs to be unzipped).

An example of a generated output file is as follows:

```json
{
    "c13acdc7567b225971cef2416a3a2b03c8a4d8d154df48afe75834e2f5c59ddf": {
        "proxy-function": "video-processing-python-10"
    },
    "a2faad786b3c813b12ce57d349d5e62f6d0f22ceecfa86cd72a962853383b600": {
        "proxy-function": "image-rotate-go-11"
    },
    "7dc5aeabc131669912e8c793c8925cc9928321f45f13a4af031592b4611630d7": {
        "proxy-function": "video-processing-python-70"
    },
    "ae8a1640fa932024f59b38a0b001808b5c64612bd60c6f3eb80ba9461ba2d091": {
        "proxy-function": "video-processing-python-20"
    }
}
```

The mapper output file will be stored in the trace directory with the name `mapper_output.json` by default. The output file contains the mapping of the trace functions to the proxy functions in the vSwarm benchmark suite.

### vSwarm statistics

The vSwarm benchmark suite has been profiled and the statistics of the functions are stored in the `profile.json` file. The statistics include the memory and duration details of the functions **(as profiled on two Intel Xeon Silver 4114 10-core CPUs at 2.20 GHz with 192GB of DDR4 RAM)**. The below table gives an overview of broad statistics of the functions in the vSwarm benchmark suite.

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Minimum Duration (ms) | 0.7466532679738556 ms |
| Maximum Duration (ms) | 27459.274496825394 ms |
| Average Duration (ms) | 2612.325542552247 ms |
| Minimum Memory (MB) | 24.235294117647058 MB |
| Maximum Memory (MB) | 1293.3715789473683 MB |
| Average Memory (MB) | 142.66478734351986 MB |

### Error metrics and mapping accuracy 

We have evaluated the accuracy and effectiveness of the mapper tool using the following metrics:

- Duration CDF plot of the trace functions and the mapping that is generated
- Wasserstein distance (WD) plot between the trace functions and the mapped functions

As mentioned previously, the maximum function duration that we can achieve with vSwarm functions is near 27 seconds, and so, for the WD plot, we exclude trace functions that are beyond this duration to have a better comparison of the mapping accuracy.

The CDF plot of the trace functions and the mapped functions is as follows:

![CDF plot of trace functions and mapped functions](mapper_cdf.png)

As we can see, the mapping is quite accurate for the majority of the functions. The WD plot is as follows:

![Wasserstein distance plot between trace functions and mapped functions](WD.png)

The dropped functions plot is as shown below:

![Functions dropped from the WD plot](WD_dropped_data.png)

Beyond this, we also display the following error metrics whenever the mapper is run with a trace:

- Average memory error
- Average duration error
- Average absolute memory error
- Average absolute duration error
- Average relative memory error
- Average relative duration error
- Average absolute relative memory error
- Average absolute relative duration error
- Functions in the trace with 0 duration
- Number of mapped functions with higher than 40% duration error (replaced by InVitro sample functions)
